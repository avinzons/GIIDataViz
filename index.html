          <h1 class="page-title">What is Global Innovation Index?</h1>
          <p>The Global Innovation Index (GII) aims to capture the multi-dimensional facets of innovation and provide the tools that can assist in tailoring policies to promote long-term output growth, improved productivity, and job growth.</p>
          <!--insert graphic of global innovation index description-->
          <p class="page-subtitle">How is GII Calculated?</p>
          <!-- <p>The GII relies on two sub-indices—the Innovation Input Sub-Index and the Innovation Output Sub-Index—each computed around key pillars.</p> -->
          <p>The GII is a weighted average of seven different sub-indexes:</p>

        <p>The political regime data ranges on a scale from -10 (full autocracy) to 10 (full democracy). Democracies are distinct from autocratic countries in which political preferences cannot be expressed and citizens are not guaranteed civil liberties. Anocracies – a term used often in this entry – are regimes that fall in the middle of the spectrum of autocracies and democracies. Anocracies are countries which are not fully autocratic, but which can also not be called democratic.</p>
